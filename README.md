# OPT Catalog

OPT Catalog is a simple mobile application for searching products in a database. The entire product list is stored in a JSON file named `json_product_list.json`, which should be located in the `assets` folder.

## Functionality
- On application startup, the Room database is checked.
- If the database is empty, the products from `json_product_list.json` are loaded into it.
- Users can search for products within the database.

## Requirements
- The `json_product_list.json` file must be placed in the `assets` folder.
- The application utilizes Room for database management.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the `json_product_list.json` file in the `assets` folder.
3. Build and run the application.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Room Database
- Hilt for Dependency Injection
